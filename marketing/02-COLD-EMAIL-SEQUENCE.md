## EMAIL 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject Lines (test multiple):**
- Quick question about {{company_name}}
- Funding for {{city}} businesses
- {{first_name}} — 2 min question

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

I work with {{city}} business owners to help them access $50K-$150K in funding — without the bank runaround.

Not sure if this is relevant for {{company_name}}, but if you've ever thought about:
- Expanding or hiring
- New equipment or inventory
- Marketing or working capital

…I'd be happy to do a quick assessment and show you what options are available.

No credit pull. No fees until you're funded. Just a 10-minute call to see if we can help.

Worth a quick chat?

## EMAIL 2: Follow-Up (3 days later)

**Subject Lines:**
- Re: Quick question about {{company_name}}
- Following up
- Did this get buried?

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Just floating this back up in case it got buried.

I help Atlanta businesses access $50K-$150K in funding. We recently helped a {{industry}} business in {{city}} secure $85K in under 2 weeks.

If cash flow, growth capital, or equipment financing is on your radar — happy to do a quick 10-min call to see what you'd qualify for.

Either way, no pressure. Just wanted to make sure you saw this.

## EMAIL 3: Breakup Email (5 days later)

**Subject Lines:**
- Closing the loop
- Last one from me
- Not a fit?

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

I'll keep this short — I've reached out a couple times about funding options for {{company_name}}.

Totally understand if it's not the right time. I'll close the loop here.

If you ever need $50K-$150K+ for your business down the road, feel free to reach out. Happy to help when the timing's right.

Best,
Matt
IRL Capital

P.S. — If someone else at your company handles finance/growth decisions, feel free to pass this along.
