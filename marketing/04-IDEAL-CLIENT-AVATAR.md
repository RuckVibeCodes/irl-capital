- **Industry:** Contractor, Auto Repair, Home Services
- **Role:** Owner / Operator

### Business Profile
- **Business Age:** 2-7 years

- **Employees:** 3-15
- **Credit Score:** 640-720 (workable but not perfect)
- **Entity:** LLC or S-Corp
- **Has business bank account:** Yes
- **Monthly deposits:** $25K-$100K

### Situation
- Business is stable but wants to grow
- Has a specific use for funding (equipment, hiring, marketing, bigger jobs)
- Talked to banks but got the runaround or denied
- Doesn't have time to figure out funding on his own
- Willing to pay for speed and convenience
- Not desperate — making decisions from strength, not panic

### Pain Points
- "Banks take forever and still say no"
- "I don't have time to fill out 50 applications"
- "I don't know what options are out there"
- "I need capital to take on bigger jobs"
- "My credit isn't perfect but my business is solid"

### Goals
- Get $50K-$150K in funding within 30 days
- Grow revenue by 30-50% this year
- Hire 2-3 more people
- Buy equipment to take on bigger contracts
- Build business credit for future needs

### Objections
- "What's the catch?" → Transparency about fees/rates
- "Why should I trust you?" → Local, testimonials, no upfront fees
- "Is this going to hurt my credit?" → No pull until approved
- "How fast can I get funded?" → 24-48 hours to 2 weeks

### Where He Hangs Out
- Facebook (business groups, local groups)
- Instagram (follows local businesses)
- LinkedIn (has a profile but not super active)
- YouTube (watches business/finance content)
- Local networking events (occasionally)
- Google (searches for funding options)

### How He Makes Decisions
- Wants to talk to a real person
- Reads reviews / asks for referrals
- Values speed and convenience
- Willing to pay more for better service
- Skeptical of "too good to be true" offers

## DISQUALIFIED LEADS (Avoid)

❌ **Pre-revenue startups** — Can't fund them profitably
❌ **Credit below 580** — Need credit repair first (or refer to that service)
❌ **Less than $10K/month revenue** — Too small for $50K+ funding
❌ **Already stacked with MCA debt** — Can't help, high risk
❌ **Tire kickers** — "Just exploring options" with no real need
❌ **Unrealistic expectations** — Wants $500K with a 550 credit score
