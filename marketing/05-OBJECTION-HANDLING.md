# IRL Capital — Objection Handling Script

---

## OBJECTION 1: "What's the catch?" / "How do you make money?"

**Response:**
"Great question — I'm a broker, not a lender. I connect you with lenders who pay me a commission when you get funded. You don't pay me anything upfront. My fee comes out of the deal, not your pocket. So I only get paid if you actually get funded — which means I'm only going to work with businesses I can actually help."

---

## OBJECTION 2: "Is this going to hurt my credit?"

**Response:**
"No — we don't pull your credit until you've reviewed your options and decided to move forward. The initial qualification is a soft pull or just a conversation. We only do a hard pull with your permission once you've picked an offer you want to accept."

---

## OBJECTION 3: "Why should I work with you instead of going directly to a bank?"

**Response:**
"You can absolutely try the bank — but here's the thing: banks take 4-8 weeks, require mountains of paperwork, and still say no 70% of the time for small businesses. I work with 20+ lenders who specialize in business funding. I find the best match for your situation in days, not months. And if you don't qualify for traditional lending, I have alternative options too."

---

## OBJECTION 4: "I've been burned by funding companies before."

**Response:**
"I hear you — there are definitely some bad actors out there. That's exactly why I started IRL Capital. I'm local, I'm not hiding behind a call center, and I'm upfront about costs. Let me show you exactly what you'd qualify for and what it would cost before you commit to anything. No surprises."

---

## OBJECTION 5: "The interest rate / factor rate is too high."

**Response:**
"I get it — let's look at the total cost, not just the rate. If this $75K helps you take on jobs that generate $200K+ in revenue, is the cost of capital worth it? For most business owners, the question isn't 'is funding expensive?' — it's 'what opportunities am I missing without it?' But let me also see if we have lower-cost options for your profile."

---

## OBJECTION 6: "I need to think about it."

**Response:**
"Totally fair. What specifically do you want to think through? Is it the terms, the timing, or something else? I want to make sure you have all the info you need to make a decision — even if that decision is 'not right now.'"

*(If they're vague, ask:)*
"If we could solve [their main concern], would you be ready to move forward?"

---

## OBJECTION 7: "I'm not sure I need funding right now."

**Response:**
"That's actually the best time to explore your options — when you're not desperate. Most business owners wait until they urgently need cash, and then they have fewer options and worse terms. Getting pre-qualified now means you know exactly what's available when the right opportunity comes up."

---

## OBJECTION 8: "I want to talk to my partner/spouse/accountant first."

**Response:**
"Absolutely — smart to loop them in. Would it help if I put together a one-page summary of your options so you can show them exactly what we discussed? And I'm happy to jump on a call with them if they have questions."

---

## OBJECTION 9: "How fast can I actually get the money?"

**Response:**
"Depends on the type of funding and your profile. For revenue-based lending, we're talking 24-72 hours. For lines of credit and term loans, usually 1-2 weeks. SBA loans take longer — 30-60 days — but have better rates. I'll tell you upfront what timeline to expect based on your situation."

---

## OBJECTION 10: "I don't have great credit."

**Response:**
"What range are you in — roughly? If you're above 580, we probably have options for you, especially if your business revenue is solid. We also offer credit repair services if you want to improve your score first and qualify for better terms. Let's look at what makes sense for your situation."

---

## OBJECTION 11: "I already applied with [competitor]."

**Response:**
"No problem — how'd that go? A lot of business owners come to me after getting the runaround elsewhere. I'm happy to give you a second opinion or see if I can find a better offer. No pressure either way."

---

## OBJECTION 12: "What if I get denied?"

**Response:**
"If our lenders can't fund you right now, I'll tell you exactly why and what you need to do to qualify. I'm not going to waste your time or mine on a deal that won't close. And if credit is the issue, we have repair services that can get you there."

---

## GENERAL FRAMEWORK: LAER

**L — Listen:** Let them fully express the objection. Don't interrupt.
**A — Acknowledge:** "I hear you." / "That makes sense." / "Totally fair."
**E — Explore:** "Can you tell me more about that?" / "What's the main concern?"
**R — Respond:** Address the specific concern with relevant info.

## GOLDEN RULE

Never be defensive. Objections are just questions in disguise. If someone has objections, they're still engaged. The real danger is when they say nothing and just disappear.
